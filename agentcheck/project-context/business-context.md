# Business Context Template

This file gets auto-generated on first AgentCheck run. It will contain:

**Purpose**: [What the project does and why it exists]
**Users**: [Who uses the system - customer types, personas]
**Success Metrics**: [How success is measured - KPIs, user satisfaction] 
**Revenue Impact**: [Business impact of bugs/issues - downtime costs, user churn]

*Template gets replaced with project-specific business context during initialization.*
